## 📌 Projects Included

### 🧬 Genetic Algorithm (GA)
An implementation of a Genetic Algorithm to optimize a function using key evolutionary principles.

**Features:**
- Tournament selection
- Crossover and mutation operations
- Fitness value calculation
- Visualization of fitness values (chart output)

---

### 🤖 Fuzzy Logic System
A fuzzy logic system for decision making based on input variables such as **sensitivity**, **amount**, and **dirtiness**.

**Features:**
- Triangular and trapezoidal membership functions
- Mamdani inference method
- Defuzzification (to calculate outputs like rotation speed, time, and detergent amount)
- Rule-based evaluation with adjustable parameters

---

### 🧭 A* Pathfinding Algorithm
An implementation of the A* (A-star) algorithm to solve the **8-puzzle problem** efficiently.

**Features:**
- Manhattan distance heuristic
- Step-by-step solution trace
- Display of intermediate states in a list

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Visual Studio** (Recommended: 2019 or later)
- **.NET Framework** (WinForms-compatible version, e.g., 4.7.2)

---

## 📝 Notes

- All projects are developed for **educational** and **demonstration** purposes.
- `.gitignore` excludes common build artifacts (`bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`).
- Encoding issues (e.g., Turkish characters) may occur if your editor is not set to **UTF-8**.
